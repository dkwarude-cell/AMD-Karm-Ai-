# KARM AI — Video Script

### Theme 7: AI in Consumer Experiences

### Duration: ~4–5 minutes

---

## 🎬 SCENE 1 — THE HOOK (0:00 – 0:25)

**[VISUAL: Dark screen. A single glowing dot appears center screen — the Karm AI "K" logo animates in with the gradient glow. Ambient electronic music fades in softly.]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**

> "You walk to the same canteen counter every day. You sit with the same three people. You attend the same type of events. You think you're experiencing college — but you're actually trapped in a bubble you can't see."

**[VISUAL: A small, tight circle with icons — food, friends, route — repeating in a loop. The circle pulses like a cage.]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**

> "What if AI could gently break that cage open?"

**[VISUAL: The circle cracks. Light pours out. Title card fades in: **KARM AI — Structured Serendipity Engine**]**

---

## 🎬 SCENE 2 — THE PROBLEM (0:25 – 1:10)

**[VISUAL: Split-screen of two college students — one eating alone at the same counter, the other scrolling past events they never attend. Zoom into a phone showing a generic recommendation feed — "Based on what you already like…"]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**

> "Every recommendation engine today does the same thing — it looks at what you already do, and gives you more of the same. Netflix shows you more thrillers. Spotify plays the same genre. Your campus app suggests the same CS workshops."

**[VISUAL: A filter bubble visualized — the student's world shrinking into a smaller and smaller circle.]**

> "This is the **filter bubble problem**. And on a college campus, it's devastating. Students graduate having interacted with only 2 out of 14 departments. They never meet the architecture student whose spatial thinking could transform their robotics project. They never discover the philosophy lecture that rewires how they think about AI ethics."

**[VISUAL: Stats appear on screen:]**

- **78% of students** eat at the same canteen counter daily
- **65% never attend** an event outside their department
- **4 out of 14 departments** — average student exploration in 4 years

> "The real loss isn't just missed events — it's missed **creative collisions**. The best ideas in history happened when different worlds met."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 3 — INTRODUCING KARM AI (1:10 – 1:50)

**[VISUAL: Phone screen — Karm AI home page loads with smooth animation. The daily drift card appears with the spring animation.]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**

> "Karm AI is a **Structured Serendipity Engine** — the first anti-recommendation engine for campus life. Instead of trapping you in what you already know, it calculates the **minimum effective drift** to push you towards something meaningfully different."

**[VISUAL: The math formula appears elegantly:]**

```
MED(s) = argmin_d ||d||_friction  s.t.  ΔB(s,d) ≥ ε
```

> "In plain English — what is the smallest, lowest-friction change in your routine that creates the biggest expansion of your world?"

**[VISUAL: A drift card example: "Try Counter 7 instead of Counter 2 today — a Philosophy + Fine Arts student eats here regularly. 91% creative collision potential." The "Why this?" button glows.]**

> "And here's the key — every recommendation is **transparent**. Tap 'Why this drift?' and you see the exact reasoning."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 4 — FEATURE WALKTHROUGH (1:50 – 3:20)

### 4A — Transparent Recommender: "Why This?" (1:50 – 2:15)

**[VISUAL: User taps "Why this?" — the DriftReasoningModal opens. Animated progress bars fill in: Complementary Skills 85%, Shared Hidden Interests 72%, Timing Alignment 90%, Gap Profile Match 88%. The collision score counts up to 91%.]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**

> "We don't just say 'try this.' We show you the **collision score breakdown** — how complementary your skills are with people you'd meet, shared hidden interests you didn't know about, and how long it's been since you crossed into a new department."

> "Criterion one: **Transparent recommenders** — every suggestion has a visible 'why.'"

### 4B — KarmBot: Conversational Assistant (2:15 – 2:40)

**[VISUAL: User taps the floating KarmBot button (new animated K logo). Chat panel opens. User types: "What's happening tonight? I have 90 minutes and zero budget." KarmBot responds with contextual recommendations, respecting time and budget constraints.]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**

> "KarmBot is our AI-powered conversational assistant. It understands your **time budget, interests, and bubble state** — and it only talks about campus discovery. Ask it 'I'm bored' and it doesn't Google things — it finds the event that breaks your bubble the most."

> "Criterion two: **Conversational assistants with budget and constraint awareness.**"

### 4C — Bubble Dashboard: Your Campus Footprint (2:40 – 3:00)

**[VISUAL: Navigate to Bubble Dashboard. The animated SVG bubble visualization renders — visited departments glow green, unvisited ones pulse in red. The bubble percentage counts up. Stats cards animate in: Department Coverage, Canteen Variety, Event Diversity, New Connections.]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**

> "The Bubble Dashboard gives you a live map of your campus footprint. It uses a **product-complement function** — even one unexplored dimension pulls your score down. You can literally see which 10 departments you've never stepped into. And one tap says 'Drift here.'"

> "Criterion five: **Feedback loops that prevent filter bubbles and promote discovery.**"

### 4D — Explore Page with "Why This" Scores (3:00 – 3:10)

**[VISUAL: Explore page shows events with personalized relevance scores and "Why this?" tags — "Expands your bubble — you haven't explored Music yet", "Matches your interest in AI", "3 departments you've never met — high collision potential".]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**

> "Every event on the Explore page has a **personalized relevance score** with transparent reasoning. Budget-friendly? Time-fits? Cross-departmental collision potential? All visible."

### 4E — Creator Studio: Club & Team Tools (3:10 – 3:20)

**[VISUAL: Creator Studio — user selects a Workshop template, enters event name, picks brand colors. AI generates three copy suggestions. Preview card renders in real-time with the brand colors. "Publish as Discovery Slot" button glows.]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**

> "And for the supply side — Creator Studio gives clubs AI-assisted copy generation, brand templates, and one-click Discovery Slot publishing."

> "Criterion four: **Creator tools for consistent, on-brand media.**"

---

## 🎬 SCENE 5 — THE USP / WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT (3:20 – 3:55)

**[VISUAL: Screen splits into two columns — "Normal Recommendation Engines" vs "Karm AI"]**

| Normal Engines        | Karm AI                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Maximize engagement   | Maximize exploration                            |
| Show more of the same | Show the minimum-effective different            |
| Black-box "for you"   | Transparent "why this" on every card            |
| Similarity scoring    | **Complementarity scoring** — opposites collide |
| Static preferences    | Living **Serendipity Fingerprint** that evolves |
| No friction awareness | MED — smallest friction for biggest impact      |
| Content consumption   | Real-world campus action                        |

**NARRATOR (V/O):**

> "Most AI recommenders score **similarity**. Karm AI scores **complementarity** — it finds people whose skills fill your gaps and whose perspectives challenge yours. Our collision formula weighs skill complementarity, shared hidden interests, departmental diversity, and timing alignment."

> "And the **Serendipity Fingerprint** — built from your drift history — gets smarter with every drift you accept. Six axes: cross-departmental reach, spontaneity, social openness, creative exposure, exploratory range, and timing flexibility. It's like a personality type — but for how you discover."

## 🎬 SCENE 6 — TECH STACK & ARCHITECTURE (3:55 – 4:15)

**[VISUAL: Clean architecture diagram animates in:]**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Frontend: React + Framer Motion + Zustand  │
│  Glassmorphism UI / SVG Data Viz / PWA      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Backend: FastAPI + Python                  │
│  NudgeEngine (ε-Greedy MAB)                 │
│  CollisionScorer (Complementarity)          │
│  FingerprintBuilder (Bayesian Update)       │
│  AttractorMapper (Product-Complement B(s))  │
│  KarmBot (OpenRouter / Llama 3 / Mistral)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  AI Layer: Constrained LLM via OpenRouter   │
│  Multi-model fallback (4 models)            │
│  Scoped system prompt — campus only         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**NARRATOR (V/O):**

> "Built with React, Framer Motion, and FastAPI. The AI layer uses an epsilon-greedy multi-armed bandit to balance exploration vs exploitation in drift selection. KarmBot runs on OpenRouter with multi-model fallback — Llama 3, Mistral, Qwen — all through a tightly scoped system prompt that prevents off-topic responses."

## 🎬 SCENE 7 — WHAT'S NEXT / FUTURE ROADMAP (4:15 – 4:40)

**[VISUAL: Roadmap cards animate in one by one:]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**

> "Where we're going next:"

1. **🗺️ Real-Time Campus Heatmap** — live density maps showing which spaces are underexplored right now, turning campus into a dynamic discovery grid.

2. **🤝 Collision Matchmaking** — opt-in pairing with complementary students for coffee or co-working. Not dating — creative collisions by design.

3. **♿ Accessibility-Aware Routing** — campus navigation that respects mobility constraints, elevator availability, and sensory preferences.

4. **📊 Institutional Insights Dashboard** — anonymized analytics for university administrators showing cross-departmental engagement trends, helping them design better spaces and events.

5. **🔔 Smart Drift Notifications** — context-aware push nudges that fire at the right moment (walking past a department, free period detected) instead of generic scheduled alerts.

6. **🌐 Multi-Campus Federation** — connect Karm AI instances across universities for inter-campus discovery during fests and conferences.

## 🎬 SCENE 8 — THE CLOSE (4:40 – 5:00)

**[VISUAL: Return to the student from Scene 2 — but now they're at a different canteen counter, talking to someone from a different department. Smiling. The Karm AI bubble visualization shows their circle has expanded.]**

**NARRATOR (V/O):**

> "College is four years. But most students experience only 15% of it. Karm AI doesn't tell you what to consume — it tells you where to **drift**. Because the best version of your campus life isn't the one you planned. It's the one you discovered."

**[VISUAL: Karm AI logo pulses. Tagline fades in:]**

### **KARM AI — Break Your Bubble. Find Your Drift.**

**[VISUAL: QR code or URL to the live demo. Team names. Fade to black.]**

## 🎙️ SPEAKER NOTES

- **Tone**: Confident, warm, slightly idealistic. Not salesy — passionate about the problem.
- **Pace**: Moderate. Pause after the hook line. Let the visuals breathe.
- **Music**: Lo-fi ambient electronic. No lyrics. Build intensity at Scene 5, soften at close.
- **Length target**: 4:30–5:00. Cut Scene 6 (tech stack) if running long — judges can ask about it in Q&A.
